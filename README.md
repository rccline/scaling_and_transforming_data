# Scaling and Transforming Data 



## 1. Transforming and Scaling Data and working with Z Scores in R.  
**A tutorial created by " Matúš Seči (m.seci@ed.ac.uk)" and published on OurCodingClub GitHub repository**.    

The data are derived from the [**Living Planet Index**](https://livingplanetindex.org/) which is an open-source database containing population data of a large number of species from all around the planet.

**Tutorial aims**:

1.  Understand the purpose of transformations and scaling in statistical analysis.
2.  Understand the underlying mathematics and use appropriate syntax and packages in R to apply both common and more advanced transformations and scaling procedures.
3.  Learn how to reverse transformations and scaling to obtain estimates and predictions in the original units of measure.
4.  Learn how to change the scales on the plot axes and label them appropriately.
5.  Learn how to apply these concepts to real problems in ecology and environmental sciences involving data through worked examples.  

## 2.  How to Calculate Z Scores  
**A tutorial from David Longstreet's *statisticsisfun* channel, "How to calculate Z scores" (2011), <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypf6eAP9aFg>]**

It uses a dataset of Cholesterol levels in men 18-24 years of age, normally distributed with a *mean of 178* and a *SD of 40*. ^[These problems are found in the tutorial from David Longstreet's *statisticsisfun* channel, "How to calculate Z scores" (2011), <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypf6eAP9aFg>] 

## 3. "How to Scale Only Numeric Columns in R"

**Tutorial from [DataScienceTut - How to scale only numeric columns by 'Jim'](https://datasciencetut.com/how-to-scale-only-numeric-columns-in-r/)**  using dplyr from the Tidyverse and the *scale()* function.
